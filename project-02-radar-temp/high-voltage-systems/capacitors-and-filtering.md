# Capacitors and Filtering 

The role of capacitors and filtering in the HV system and are critical to radar performance and safety.

## Energy Storage Function

HV capacitors:
- Store energy between pulses
- Smooth voltage ripple
- Supply peak current during transmission

They are typically:
- Oil-filled, ceramic or Polypropylene coated
- Capable of retaining charge after shutdown

---

## Aging and Degradation

Capacitors degrade through:
- Dielectric breakdown
- Increased ESR
- Leakage current

Effects on operation:
- Weak or inconsistent transmit pulses
- Increased noise
- Reduced effective range

Capacitor degradation is often gradual and difficult to detect without prior knowledge.

## Stored Energy Hazard

Even when power is removed:
- Capacitors may remain charged
- Discharge time varies unpredictably

Assume capacitors are charged until tested or proven otherwise.
