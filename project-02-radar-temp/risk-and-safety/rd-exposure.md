# RF Exposure Risks 

While RF exposure is less immediately dramatic than high voltage, it presents serious long-term and acute risks.

## Nature of the RF Hazard

The GMR 18 HD3 transmits:
- Up to ~4 kW peak RF power
- At ~9.4 GHz (X-band)
- In focused, directional beams

Although average power is low, **peak field strength near the antenna is high**.

## Exposure Characteristics 

At ~9.4 GHz:
- RF energy is absorbed superficially
- Tissue heating occurs rapidly
- Pain may not be immediate

The eyes are particularly vulnerable due to poor heat dissipation. Thermal injuries may occur depending on exposure duration and the 
specific area of the body affected. In addition, exposure to high levels of non-ionizing energy may pose risks of neurological effects, 
increased cancer risk, and potential reproductive harm.

## Risk Conditions

Elevated RF exposure risk occurs when:
- Radome is open
- Antenna is exposed
- Radar is operated at close range
- Interlocks are bypassed (intentionally or unintentionally)

These conditions were avoided during maintenance.

---

## Observations and Controls

During any powered operation:
- The antenna plane was kept clear at all times
- No operation occurred with exposed waveguides
- The radar was not energized during physical inspection

No RF field measurements were attempted.

## Key Takeaways

- RF exposure risk exists even at short duty cycles
- X-band energy presents specific hazards due to its frequency, power density, and exposure characteristics.
- Never operate with RF path open
