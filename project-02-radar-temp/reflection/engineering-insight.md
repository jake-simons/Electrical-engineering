# Engineering Insight & Reflection

## Project Scope and Maintenance Constraints

This project did not aim to redesign or optimize the radar system, but to assess its continued safe and reliable operation under real-world maintenance constraints. 

The primary engineering outcomes were risk reduction, failure prevention, and improved system understanding rather than quantitative performance improvements.

## Engineering Judgment and Risk Reduction

Through non-invasive inspection and theory-informed analysis, several potential failure modes were evaluated and either mitigated or ruled out. These included high-voltage safety risks associated with the radar power supply, grounding and bonding degradation due to the marine environment, and age-related wear mechanisms affecting the magnetron and RF transmission path.

A key outcome of this work was preventing unsafe or unnecessary diagnostic actions. By understanding which subsystems were sealed, manufacturer-certified, or unsafe to probe directly, the maintenance process avoided invasive measurements that could have damaged the equipment or posed a safety hazard. This reinforced the importance of respecting system boundaries in real-world engineering environments.

While no active faults were discovered during maintenance, the analysis helped reduce the likelihood of latent failures. Grounding integrity checks and corrosion awareness reduced the risk of unpredictable high-voltage discharge paths. Understanding magnetron operating principles and aging characteristics reduced the chance of misdiagnosing normal performance degradation as an electrical fault.

## Lessons on Practical Engineering

One of the main lessons from this project was that maintenance engineering often operates with incomplete information. Unlike design work, component-level specifications, schematics, and test points are frequently unavailable. In such cases, engineering judgment relies on system-level theory, manufacturer documentation, and an understanding of what information is not accessible or safe to obtain.

This project reinforced that practical engineering lives at the intersection of theory, real-world constraints, and risk, and that meaningful understanding comes from recognizing how these factors shape every engineering decision.
