# Inspection Checklist

This inspection was conducted before focusing on specific subsystems such as grounding, magnetron operation, or high-voltage integrity.

## Purpose of Initial Inspection

Marine radars operate in a harsh environment. Before evaluating performance, it is essential to verify that:
- The system is mechanically intact
- No corrosion or contamination is present
- Electrical connections appear sound
- No evidence of overheating or arcing exists

Skipping this step can lead to misdiagnosis or unsafe testing conditions.

## Areas Inspected

### External Radome
- No cracks or UV damage
- Radome seal intact
- No signs of water ingress

### Internal Visual Inspection
- No loose fasteners
- No burnt components
- No carbon tracking or discoloration
- No damaged insulation

---

## Observations to Watch For

- White or green powdery residue (aluminum or copper corrosion)
- Rust staining near fasteners
- Black soot indicating arcing
- Swollen capacitors
- Brittle or hardened wiring insulation

Any of these signs justify stopping further testing until resolved.
