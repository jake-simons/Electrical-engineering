# Inspection Checklist

This inspection was conducted before focusing on specific subsystems such as grounding, magnetron operation, or high-voltage integrity.

## Purpose of Initial Inspection

Marine radars operate in a harsh environment. Before evaluating performance, it is essential to verify that:
- The system is mechanically intact
- No corrosion or contamination is present
- Electrical connections appear sound
- No evidence of overheating or arcing exists

Skipping this step can lead to misdiagnosis or unsafe testing conditions.

## Areas Inspected

### External Radome
- No cracks or UV damage
- Radome seal intact
- No signs of water ingress

The seals showed mild signs of wear but remained intact, with no visible cracking. The seal material was noticeably stiffer 
than that of a factory-new component; this observation was documented and the seals may be replaced at the next inspection.

### Internal Visual Inspection
- No loose fasteners
- No burnt components
- No carbon tracking or discoloration
- No damaged insulation

All components and fasteners showed no signs of breakage or significant wear. Minor calcified deposits were observed on some fasteners; 
however, these were limited to areas outside the radome where components are subject to continuous exposure to marine aerosols. Based on 
their location and extent, the condition was deemed acceptable.

## Observations to Watch For

- White or green powdery residue (aluminum or copper corrosion)
- Rust staining near fasteners
- Black soot indicating arcing
- Swollen capacitors
- Brittle or hardened wiring insulation

Any of these conditions would warrant halting further testing until resolved. No such issues were identified during a comprehensive internal inspection.
