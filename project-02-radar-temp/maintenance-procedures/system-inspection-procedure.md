# Inspection Checklist

This inspection was conducted before focusing on specific subsystems such as grounding, magnetron operation, or high-voltage integrity.

## Purpose of Initial Inspection

Marine radars operate in a harsh environment. Before evaluating performance, it is essential to verify that:
- The system is mechanically intact
- No corrosion or contamination is present
- Electrical connections appear sound
- No evidence of overheating or arcing exists

Skipping this step can lead to misdiagnosis or unsafe testing conditions.

## Inspection Approach and Safety

The first step in the inspection process was verifying that the system was fully powered down. Adequate time was allowed for high-voltage components 
to discharge before any internal access was performed.

The inspection was intentionally limited to visual and non-invasive evaluation methods. No destructive actions were taken. Testing was restricted 
to low-energy measurements such as continuity, resistance, capacitance, and isolation checks on accessible portions of the transformer assembly.

The objective of this inspection was to assess the overall condition and serviceability of the system, rather than to perform energized or performance-based testing.

## Extenrnal Inspection

### External Radome
- No cracks or UV damage
- Radome seal intact
- No signs of water ingress
- Connectors and Cable Entry points 

The seals showed mild signs of wear but remained intact, with no visible cracking. The seal material was noticeably stiffer 
than that of a factory-new component; this observation was documented and the seals may be replaced at the next inspection.

Both the physical connectors and cable entry points were free of debris, and no fraying or cracking of the insulation was observed.

### Internal Inspection

HV Capacitor Unit

| Aspect Checked          | Overview |
| ------------------------|----------|
| Bulging or Deformation  | No Signs observed |
| Electrolyte Leakage     | No Signs of leakage |
| Thermal Stress  or Discoloration | No signs present |
| Capacitance rating      | ~1.2 µF |

Visual inspection of the capacitor housing showed no evidence of mechanical deformation, electrolyte leakage, or heat-related discoloration. 
The measured capacitance of approximately 1.2 µF falls within the expected range for the given component.

Based on visual condition and measured value, the capacitor shows no obvious indicators of degradation and appears suitable for continued 
service. As with all high-voltage components, periodic re-evaluation is recommended due to environmental and electrical stress factors 
associated with marine radar operation.

- HV Capacitor Unit
- HV Transformer Unit
- No carbon tracking or discoloration
- No damaged insulation

All components and fasteners showed no signs of breakage or significant wear. Minor calcified deposits were observed on some fasteners; 
however, these were limited to areas outside the radome where components are subject to continuous exposure to marine aerosols. Based on 
their location and extent, the condition was deemed acceptable.

## Observations to Watch For

- White or green powdery residue (aluminum or copper corrosion)
- Rust staining near fasteners
- Black soot indicating arcing
- Swollen capacitors
- Brittle or hardened wiring insulation

Any of these conditions would warrant halting further testing until resolved. No such issues were identified during a comprehensive internal inspection.
