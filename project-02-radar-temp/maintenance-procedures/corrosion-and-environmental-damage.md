# Corrosion and Environmental Damage 

Given the operational challenges of the radar in a saltwater environment, this procedure covers inspection and mitigation of corrosion and environmental damage caused by prolonged marine exposure.

## Why This Check Is Critical

Salt, humidity, and thermal cycling can:
- Degrade RF paths
- Increase HV leakage
- Compromise grounding
- Accelerate component aging

Salt water and marine aerosols are particularly damaging to electronic systems because they are both corrosive and electrically conductive. The salt component acts as an electrolyte, significantly 
increasing surface conductivity and accelerating oxidation. Together, these effects present a major challenge in the design and maintenance of marine radar systems and must not be overlooked. Ensuring 
that gaskets and seals are properly installed and well maintained is a critical first step in extending system lifespan.

At X-band frequencies especially, minor corrosion can cause noticeable performance loss.

## Areas Examined

- Grounding points
- Waveguide interfaces
- Fasteners and brackets
- PCB solder joints
- Cable connectors

## Procedure Performed

1. Visual inspection under good lighting
2. Magnified inspection of waveguide and RF interfaces
3. Identification of salt residue and oxidation
4. Cleaning using appropriate non-abrasive methods
5. Resealing where necessary to prevent moisture ingress

Corrosion near RF connectors or grounding points would not only weaken mechanical integrity but could introduce impedance changes or unintended radiating paths, degrading radar performance and potentially increasing EMI.
