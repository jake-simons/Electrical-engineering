# Magnetron Health Checks 

This procedure documents how the magnetron’s basic operational conditions were verified without destructive testing.

## Why the Magnetron Must Be Checked

The magnetron is the RF source of the radar. For proper operation:
- The anode block must be solidly grounded
- The cathode must receive the correct high voltage
- Filament integrity must be intact

Failures here directly impact radar output.

## What Was Verified

- Anode block grounding continuity
- Presence of HV supply to the cathode (non-invasive confirmation)
- Physical condition of magnetron connections
- Absence of arcing or thermal damage

## Procedure Performed

1. Confirmed anode-to-chassis ground continuity using a DMM 
2. Inspected magnetron terminals for corrosion or looseness
3. Verified filament connections were intact
4. Ensured HV cabling was properly seated and insulated
5. Observed radar behavior during controlled power-on

Proper electrical bonding between the magnetron body and chassis ground was verified using a handheld DMM, with measured resistance <0.2 Ω. 
This confirms an intact return path, which is essential for safe magnetron operation and RF containment. Ground continuity measurements are 
discussed further in the grounding section.

Minor surface corrosion was observed at the magnetron grounding interface. Light mechanical cleaning was performed to remove these deposits as a 
preventative measure to preserve grounding integrity.

## Warning Signs

- Loose magnetron terminals
- Carbon tracking near HV connectors
- Discolored ceramic insulators
- Intermittent radar output

Magnetron issues are often secondary to HV or grounding problems.
