# Engineering Insight & Reflection

The most valuable outcome of this project was not restoring or verifying radar output, but understanding why idealized electrical models break down in marine systems.

Theoretical models describe how the magnetron, high-voltage supply, and RF path should behave under controlled conditions. The maintenance work showed that real performance is dominated by grounding quality, environmental degradation, and system-level interactions that theory alone cannot fully capture.

Direct measurement was often impractical or unsafe, requiring reliance on observation, continuity, and inference rather than ideal test conditions.

Engineering in a marine environment exists in the space between theory, practice, and risk.
