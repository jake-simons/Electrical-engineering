# Grounding and Bonding

This procedure documents the grounding and bonding checks performed on the radar unit. Proper grounding is essential for RF clarity, high-voltage stability, and personnel safety.

This was the first electrical subsystem verified.

## Why Grounding Matters

In a magnetron-based radar:
- The anode block relies on a solid ground reference
- HV return paths must be low impedance
- RF noise and interference are minimized by proper bonding

Poor grounding can cause:
- Erratic radar returns
- Increased noise floor
- Stress on HV components
- Unsafe fault conditions

---

## What Was Checked

- Chassis-to-ground continuity
- Magnetron anode grounding
- Bonding between power supply, RF, and mechanical assemblies
- Corrosion at grounding points

---

## Procedure Performed

1. Power was fully removed and verified off
2. All ground straps and bonding points were visually inspected
3. Corrosion was removed where present
4. Mechanical tightness of ground fasteners was verified
5. Continuity was checked between:
   - Magnetron anode and chassis
   - Chassis and vessel ground
   - HV supply ground and chassis

## What to Look Out For

- High resistance across ground paths
- Loose or oxidized fasteners
- Ground straps with broken strands
- Paint or corrosion between bonding surfaces

Grounding issues are one of the most common causes of degraded radar performance in marine environments.
