# High Voltage Risks 

The radar unit contains circuits capable of storing and delivering **lethal energy**, even when powered off. It is imperitive to take the correct measures in order to prevent injury and maintain integrity of the system.

## Nature of the High-Voltage Hazard

The GMR 18 HD3 uses a magnetron-based transmitter requiring several kilovolts of DC. The HV system includes:

- High-voltage transformer
- Voltage multiplier network
- High-voltage capacitors
- Magnetron internal capacitance

These components can:
- Store charge after power is removed
- Discharge unpredictably
- Arc across contaminated or moist surfaces

The danger is **not theoretical**, stored energy can persist from ranges such as a few minutes to a few days depending on the specific model/system.

### What Was Observed / Verified

Before any internal inspection:
- Power was removed and verified off
- Time was allowed for passive discharge
- HV areas were treated as energized regardless

---

## Arc, Flashover, and Tracking Risks

High voltage can:
- Jump air gaps
- Track along salt or moisture residue
- Arc internally without visible warning

After allowing sufficient time for discharge and completing an initial system assessment, insulated tools were used to confirm that the high-voltage capacitor assembly was fully discharged. Marine contamination significantly reduces insulation margins and increases electrical risk.

## Magnetron-Specific HV Risks

The magnetron presents unique hazards:
- The anode block is tied to ground potential
- The cathode operates at high negative voltage
- Ceramic insulators can store charge

Risks include:
- Shock from residual cathode charge
- Flashover near ceramic feedthroughs

No direct probing of magnetron HV terminals was performed until all prior saftey measures were taken.

---

## Risk Mitigation Principles Applied

- HV areas treated as energized at all times
- No direct hand contact near HV components
- Insulated tools only
- No unnecessary disturbance of HV wiring

The goal was **verification by observation and continuity**, not intrusive testing.

---

## Key Takeaways

- High voltage remains dangerous after shutdown
- Stored energy is invisible and unpredictable
- Marine contamination increases arc risk
- Many injuries occur during “routine” checks
- Respect for HV systems is non-negotiable
