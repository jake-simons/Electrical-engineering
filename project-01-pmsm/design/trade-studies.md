## Torque–Speed Tradeoffs


Three design levers were evaluated:


### Rotor Diameter Increase
- ↑ Torque via increased lever arm
- ↑ Rotational inertia
- ↓ Acceleration and low-speed efficiency


### Increased Turns per Coil
- ↑ Torque constant
- ↑ Back-EMF
- ↓ Maximum achievable speed


### Increased Pole Count
- ↑ Torque density
- ↑ Back-EMF
- ↑ Mechanical stress and failure risk


No configuration improves torque, speed, and efficiency simultaneously.
