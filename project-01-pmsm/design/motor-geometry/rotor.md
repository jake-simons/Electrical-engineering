The initial rotor design employed claw-pole geometry. After testing, it was determined that an interior permanent magnet (IPM) rotor configuration was required to achieve improved performance. Slots were machined into the claw poles to accommodate neodymium magnets, and an additional set of bearings was installed to increase shaft rigidity.
